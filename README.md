# On Robust Electric Network Frequency Detection Using Huber Regression

We would like to acknowledge (Hua et al.) for their work [Detection of Electric Network Frequency in Audio Recordingsâ€“From Theory to Practical Detectors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143185) which inspired us to develop our robust detector. We would like to thank them for sharing their codes in [ENF_Detection](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF_Detection) folder. 

# Our Paper

This repo contains the codes of the proposed Huber ENF detector described in the [**On Robust Electric Network Frequency Detection Using Huber Regression**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3635059.3635098) paper. The paper is published in the proceedings of the ***Proceedings of the 27th Pan-Hellenic Conference on Progress in Computing and Informatics*** (PCI 2023).

# Dataset

For the evaluation of our method, we used the H0 and H1 folders of the [ENF-WHU-Dataset](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF-WHU-Dataset).

# MATLAB Codes

1. **Calculate_Accuracy.m**
2. **Calculate_ROC_AUC.m**
